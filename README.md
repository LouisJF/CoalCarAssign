To build a level, grab and place green cubes on the "Build Table".  
This will create a larger version of the cubes in front of you on the "Build Floor".  
To create more cubes, tap the blue "Spawn" cube.  
To delete the cubes, put them into the red "Delete" cube on the right.  
To interact with the generated level, simplly walk up to it.  
You can use the thumb sticks for locomotion.  
To save the state of the "Build Table", tap the "Save" cube, the saved "Build Table" state will now load on restart.
